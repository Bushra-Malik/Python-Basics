# Python-Basics

This repository contains basic programs that demonstrate fundamental Python concepts such as arithmetic operations, variable handling, user input, conditional checks, and more. These examples are ideal for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding of core Python features.

## Programs Overview

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two variables.
2. **Comments Usage**: Demonstrates single-line and multi-line comments along with a "Hello, Python!" output.
3. **Greeting Message**: Prints a personalized greeting message using a string variable.
4. **Number Conversion**: Accepts a number, converts it to both float and integer formats, and prints the results.
5. **Data Types**: Declares variables of different types (integer, float, string) and prints their data types using the `type()` function.
6. **Area of Rectangle**: Calculates the area of a rectangle based on user-provided length and width.
7. **Assignment Operators**: Demonstrates the use of assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.) to modify a variable.
8. **Comparison Operators**: Compares two numbers using various comparison operators.
9. **Logical Operators**: Checks if two numbers are both greater than 0 using logical operators.
10. **List Membership**: Checks whether a specific string is present in a list.
11. **Identity Operators**: Demonstrates the use of `is` and `is not` operators to compare two variables.
12. **Arithmetic with User Input**: Performs arithmetic operations on two user-provided numbers.
13. **String to Integer Conversion**: Converts a string to an integer and multiplies it by 10.
14. **Logical Operators with Booleans**: Demonstrates the use of logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) with boolean values.
15. **Even or Odd Check**: Checks whether a user-provided number is even or odd.
