# Python-Basics

This repository contains basic Python programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts such as arithmetic operations, variable handling, user input, conditional checks, and more. These programs are ideal for beginners looking to strengthen their understanding of core Python features.

## Programs Overview

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: A script that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two variables.
2. **Comments Usage**: A program showcasing single-line and multi-line comments along with a "Hello, Python!" output.
3. **Greeting Message**: A script that prints a personalized greeting message using a string variable.
4. **Number Conversion**: A program that accepts a number, converts it to both float and integer formats, and prints the results.
5. **Data Types**: A script that declares variables of different types (integer, float, string) and prints their data types using the `type()` function.
6. **Area of Rectangle**: A simple program to calculate the area of a rectangle based on user-provided length and width.
7. **Assignment Operators**: A demonstration of assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.) modifying a variable.
8. **Comparison Operators**: A script that compares two numbers using various comparison operators.
9. **Logical Operators**: A program that uses logical operators to check if two numbers are both greater than 0.
10. **List Membership**: A script that checks whether a specific string is present in a list.
11. **Identity Operators**: A demonstration of the `is` and `is not` operators to compare two variables.
12. **Basic Arithmetic with User Input**: A program that performs arithmetic operations on two user-provided numbers.
13. **String to Integer Conversion**: A script that converts a string to an integer and multiplies it by 10.
14. **Logical Operators with Booleans**: A demonstration of logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) with boolean values.
15. **Even or Odd Check**: A script that checks whether a user-provided number is even or odd.
